:warning: Please, if you run into problems installing this software, **ask in the course forum**. Please do not ask the practice instructors, they absolutely do not have the bandwidth for this.

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions are conducted with a computer.

There are 09 practice sessions in this course, the handouts are Python notebooks. Download the notebooks, open them, and follow the instructions there. Each session starts with *psNN* and describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

:bulb: **Read the practice descriptions before the session,** as they can be sometimes long. You can start working on these at any point, but they are not definitive until the end of the session; details may change.

:warning: **Some parts are not visible in the preview shown on the GitHub website**, so you need to download the notebook to see the instructions.

At the end of each handout there is a description of what you should deliver. Please ask in the course forum or to your practice instructor ("*profesor/a de prácticas*") any questions you may have.

In the following table, **R** stands for remote/online session, while **F** stands for face-to-face session.
