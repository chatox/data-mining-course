    "In this session we will take a large corpus of tweets and detect near-duplicates on this corpus using a technique known as *shingling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two documents are considered near-duplicates if they share a large amount of ngrams. The *ngrams* of a phrase are overlapping sequences of words of length *n*. For instance, the phrase '*There is no call we do not answer.*' has the following 3-grams:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'there is no'\n",
    "* 'is no call'\n",
    "* 'no call we'\n",
    "* 'call we do'\n",
    "* 'we do not'\n",
    "* 'do not answer'\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the similarity between two sets, we will use the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), which is the size of the intersection of the two sets divided by their union. This values goes between 0.0 (meaning the documents have no ngrams in common) to 1.0 (meaning the documents have the same ngrams).\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up things, instead of comparing the set of shingles of two documents which can be large, we will derive a fixed-length *signature* or *sketch* for each document. This will be obtained by (1) applying a random permutation to the list of possible ngrams, and (2) pick the ngram that appears first in the permuted list. The Jaccard index between these signatures will be a good approximation of the Jaccard index between the original sets of ngrams. \n",
