    "\n",
    "The processes of getting an initial understanding of a dataset and preparing it usually go hand-in-hand, and it is critical to perform them well to obtain valid results later. Plus, you can save time and effort by learning how to do proper data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will assume you just received a new dataset and need to do some initial steps with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate basis statistics as mean, median, variance, maximum and minimum\n",
    "* Look at distributions, identify outliers\n",
    "* Calculate correlations between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deal with missing values\n",
    "* Standardize all numerical columns\n",
    "* Convert categorical columns to dummy binary variables\n",
    "* Date and period management\n",
    "* Feature generation\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tip*: This process has several steps. It is tempting to maintain a single variable throughout the entire cleaning process, and do something like `x = x.step1()` then `x = x.step2()`. This will create problems for you because if you go back and re-execute a cell it might fail to operate on already transformed data. A better approach in cases like this where you do not have memory problems, is to do `x1 = x.step1()`, `x2 = x1.step2()` and so on, i.e., create a new variable after each transformation or set of transformations.\n",
